# Techniques and Algorithms in Data Science (Pre-Machine Learning)

Welcome to my repository! My name is Matheus Carvalho, and I am an undergraduate student in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Fundação Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro. Currently, I am in my third semester and am having my first encounters with machine learning methods and algorithms.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to develop and showcase my work throughout the semester. I believe this is an excellent way to organize my progress and motivate myself to keep everything as well done as possible.

## Repository Structure

I plan to add assignments and labs proposed by Professor [Alberto Paccanaro](https://emap.fgv.br/professores/alberto-paccanaro) and some personal side projects to the repository.

### Labs

The labs are weekly activities with relatively low complexity, designed to introduce us to a specific topic in the course. All labs are organized into folders according to their theme within the `Labs` directory.

- **Lab 01** - Linear Regression I
- **Lab 02** - Linear Regression II
- **Lab 03** - Fisher's Discriminant
- **Lab 04** - Forward Pass
- **Lab 05** - Backpropagation
- **Lab 06** - Decision Trees
- **Lab 07** - Random Forest
- **Lab 08** - Virtual Screening
- **Lab 09** - HClust Tutorial

### Assignments

The assignments are more complex activities that require more extensive dedication from the student, so they represent a significant part of the course grade. All assignments are organized by topic within the `Assignments` directory.

- **Assignment 01** - Visualization and Performance Evaluation
- **Assignment 02** - Regression and Classification
- **Assignment 03** - Neural Networks
- **Assignment 04** - Decision Trees and Random Forest

### Books

For reference and study, there is a `Books` folder containing some of the main books used during the course:

1. Bishop, Christopher M. *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*. Springer, 2006.
2. Géron, Aurélien. *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems*. O'Reilly Media, 2019.
3. Duda, Richard O., Hart, Peter E., and Stork, David G. *Pattern Classification*. Wiley-Interscience, 2000.

## References

In addition to the mentioned books, other references may be added as the course and activities develop.

## Conclusion

This repository will serve as a portfolio of my progress and achievements throughout the course. Organizing files and documenting completed activities are fundamental parts of the learning and professional development process.
